centering and scaling :


* both forms of preprocessing numerical data, that is, 
	data consisting of numbers, as opposed to categories or strings

* centering a variable is subtracting the mean of the variable from each data point so that the new variable's mean is 0

* scaling a variable is multiplying each data point by a constant in order to alter the range of the data



why scale our data :

* many models use some form of distance to inform them

* features on larger scales can unduly influence the model

* example --> k-NN uses distance explicitly when making predictions

* by transforming your data you help our model work efficiently

* having all features scaled it speeds up our model,
    better accuracy and more generalized model



ways to normalize our data :

* standardization --> subtract the mean and divide by variance

* all features are centered around 0 and have variance 1

* can also subtract the minimum and divide by the range

* minimum zero and maximum one

* can also normalize so the data ranges from -1 to 1
