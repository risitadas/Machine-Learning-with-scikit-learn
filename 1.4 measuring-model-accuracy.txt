measuring model performance


* in classification, accuracy is a commonly used metric

* accuracy = fraction of correct predictions

* which data should be used to compute accuracy?

* how well will the model perform on new data?

* could compute accuracy on data used to fit classifier

* not indicative of ability to generalize

* split data into training and test set

* fit/train the classifier on the training set

* make predictions on test set
