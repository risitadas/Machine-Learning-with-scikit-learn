measuring model performance


* in classification, accuracy is a commonly used metric

* accuracy = fraction of correct predictions

* which data should be used to compute accuracy?

* how well will the model perform on new data?

* could compute accuracy on data used to fit classifier

* not indicative of ability to generalize

* split data into training and test set

* fit/train the classifier on the training set

* make predictions on test set



train test split?

train test split is a model validation procedure that allows you 
to simulate how a model would perform on new/unseen data


model complexity?

* larger k = smoother decision boundary = less complex model
* smaller k = more complex model = can lead to overfitting



overfitting?

* occurs when our machine learning model tries to cover all the data points or more than 
the required data points present in the given dataset, because of this, the model starts 
caching noise and inaccurate values present in the dataset

* these factors reduce the efficiency and accuracy of the model

* overfitted model has low bias and high variance

* chances of occurrence of overfitting increase as much we provide training to our model, means the more we train our model, 
the more chances of occurring the overfitted model

* main problem that occurs in supervised learning

for avoiding we might -->
	1. cross-Validation
	2. training with more data
	3. removing features
	4. early stopping the training
	5. regularization
	6.ensembling



underfitting?

* occurs when our machine learning model is not able to capture the underlying trend of the data

* to avoid the overfitting in the model, the fed of training data can be stopped at an early stage, 
due to which the model may not learn enough from the training data, as a result, it may fail to find the best fit of the dominant trend in the data

* the model is not able to learn enough from the training data, and hence it reduces the accuracy and produces unreliable predictions

* model has high bias and low variance

for avoiding we might --->
	1. by increasing the training time of the model
	2. by increasing the number of features
