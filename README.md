# Machine-Learning-with-scikit-learn
machine learning is the field that teaches machines and computers to learn from existing data to make predictions on new data

* learning how to use Python to perform supervised learning, an essential component of machine learning
* learning how to build predictive models, tune their parameters, 
    and determine how well they will perform with unseen dataâ€”all while using real world datasets
* also,using scikit-learn, one of the most popular and user-friendly machine learning libraries for Python
