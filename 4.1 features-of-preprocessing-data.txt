preprocessing data :


numerical features :

* features with values that are continuous on a scale, statistical, or integer-related

* numerical values are represented by whole numbers, fractions, or percentages

* numerical features can be house prices, word counts in a document, time it takes to travel somewhere, etc



categorical features :

* features whose explanations or values are taken from a defined set of possible explanations or values

* categorical values can be colors of a house; types of animals; months of the year; True/False; positive, negative, neutral, etc

* the set of possible categories that the features can fit into is predetermined

* scikit-learn will not accept categorical features by default

* need to encode categorical features numerically

* convert to " dummy variables "
	--> 0 : observation was NOT that category
	--> 1 : observation was that category

dealing with categorical features in python :

* scikit-learn : OneHotEncoder()

* pandas : get_dummies()
