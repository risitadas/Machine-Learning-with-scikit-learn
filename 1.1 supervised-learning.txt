what is machine learning ?

the art and science of :
* giving computers the ability to learn to make decisions from data
* without explicitly programmed

examples :

* learning to predict whether an email is spam or not
* clustering wikipedia entries into different categories



Unsupervised-Learning :

* uncovering hidden patterns from unlabeled data
 example :
	* grouping customers into distinct categories(clustering)


ReinforcemenT-Learning :

* software agents interact with an environment
	a) learning how to optimize their behavior
	b) given a system of rewards and punishments
	c) draws inspiration from behavioral psychology

* applications
	a) economics
	b) genetics
	c) game playing


Supervised-Learning :

* predictor variables/features and a target variable

* aim : predict the target variable, given the predictor variables
	a) classification:
		target variable consists of variables
	b) regression:
		target variable is continuous

* automate time-consuming or expensive manual tasks
	example- doctor's diagnosis

* make predictions about the future
	example- will a customer click on an ad or not?

* need labeled data
	a) historical data with labels
	b) experiments to get labeled data
	c) crowd-sourcing labeled data


supervised-learning-in python

* we will use scikit-learn/sklearn
	-integrates well with the SciPy stack

* other libraries
	- TensorFlow
	- keras
