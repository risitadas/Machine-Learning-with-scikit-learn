Classification Report in Machine Learning :



* a classification report is a performance evaluation metric in machine learning

* is one of the performance evaluation metrics of a classification-based machine learning model

* it displays our model’s precision, recall, F1 score and support

* it provides a better understanding of the overall performance of our trained model



Metrics	Definition

Precision	precision is defined as the ratio of true positives to the sum of true and false positives

Recall	recall is defined as the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false negatives

F1 Score	 the F1 is the weighted harmonic mean of precision and recall, the closer the value of the F1 score is to 1.0, 
			the better the expected performance of the model is

Support	support is the number of actual occurrences of the class in the dataset, it doesn’t vary between models, 
			it just diagnoses the performance evaluation process
