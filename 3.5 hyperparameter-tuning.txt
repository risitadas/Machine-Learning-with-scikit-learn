hyperparameter tuning


* linear regression : choosing parameters

* ridge/lasso regression : choosing alpha

* k-Nearest Neighbors : choosing n_neighbors

* parameters like alpha and k : hyperparameters

* hyperparameters cannot be learned by fitting the model



choosing the correct hyperparameter :

* try a bunch of different hyperparameter values

* fit all of them separately

* see how they performs each

* choose the best performing one

* it is essential to use cross validation
	---> grid search cross validation

GridSearchCV:

this parrticular module allows to pass our,
specific estimator, 
our grid of parameters, and,
chosen number of cross validation folds
