CLASSIFICATION

In machine learning, classification is a supervised learning concept 
which basically categorizes a set of data into classes. 

The most common classification problems are – speech recognition, 
face detection, handwriting recognition, document classification, etc.

Classification Terminologies In Machine Learning :

* Classifier – 
	It is an algorithm that is used to map the input data to a specific category

* Classification Model – 
	The model predicts or draws a conclusion to the input data given for training, 
	it will predict the class or category for the data

* Feature – 
	A feature is an individual measurable property of the phenomenon being observed

* Binary  Classification – 
	It is a type of classification with two outcomes, for eg – either true or false

* Multi-Class Classification – 
	The classification with more than two classes, in multi-class classification each sample 
	is assigned to one and only one label or target

* Multi-label Classification – 
	This is a type of classification where each sample is assigned to a set of labels or targets

* Initialize – 
	It is to assign the classifier to be used for the

* Train the Classifier – 
	Each classifier in sci-kit learn uses the fit(X, y) method to fit the model 
	for training the train X and train label y

* Predict the Target – 
	For an unlabeled observation X, the predict(X) method returns predicted label y

* Evaluate – 
	This basically means the evaluation of the model i.e classification report, accuracy score, etc



Types of Learners in Classification :

a) Lazy Learners
	Example: K-NN algorithm, Case-based reasoning

b) Eager Learners
	Example: Decision Trees, Naïve Bayes, ANN



Types of ML Classification Algorithms :

Mainly two category:

* Linear Models :
	Logistic Regression
	Support Vector Machines

* Non-linear Models :
	K-Nearest Neighbours
	Kernel SVM
	Naïve Bayes
	Decision Tree Classification
	Random Forest Classification
