REGRESSION



* a regression is a statistical technique that relates a dependent variable 
to one or more independent (explanatory) variables

* a regression model is able to show whether changes observed in the dependent variable 
are associated with changes in one or more of the explanatory variables

* it does this by essentially fitting a best-fit line and seeing how the data is dispersed around this line

* regression helps economists and financial analysts in things ranging from asset valuation to making predictions

* in order for regression results to be properly interpreted, 
several assumptions about the data and the model itself must hold
