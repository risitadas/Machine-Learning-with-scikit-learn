best python libraries for machine learning



1. Numpy

popular python library for large multi-dimensional array and matrix processing, 
with the help of a large collection of high-level mathematical functions

it is very useful for fundamental scientific computations in Machine Learning,
it is particularly useful for linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities

import numpy as np


2. SciPy

popular library among Machine Learning enthusiasts as it contains different modules for optimization, 
linear algebra, integration and statistics

there is a difference between the SciPy library and the SciPy stack

the SciPy is one of the core packages that make up the SciPy stack
the SciPy is also very useful for image manipulation

from scipy.misc import imread, imsave, imresize


3. Scikit-learn

most popular ML libraries for classical ML algorithms

it is built on top of two basic Python libraries, viz., NumPy and SciPy

Scikit-learn supports most of the supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms

Scikit-learn can also be used for data-mining and data-analysis, which makes it a great tool who is starting out with ML


from sklearn import datasets
from sklearn import metrics
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier


4. Theano

popular python library that is used to define, evaluate and optimize mathematical expressions involving multi-dimensional arrays in an efficient manner

it is achieved by optimizing the utilization of CPU and GPU

it is extensively used for unit-testing and self-verification to detect and diagnose different types of errors

Theano is a very powerful library that has been used in large-scale computationally intensive scientific projects for a long time 
but is simple and approachable enough to be used by individuals for their own projects


import theano
import theano.tensor as T


5. TensorFlow

popular open-source library for high performance numerical computation developed by the Google Brain team in Google

as the name suggests, Tensorflow is a framework that involves defining and running computations involving tensors

it can train and run deep neural networks that can be used to develop several AI applications

TensorFlow is widely used in the field of deep learning research and application


import tensorflow as tf


5. Keras

it provides many inbuilt methods for groping, combining and filtering data

Keras is a very popular Machine Learning library for Python

it is a high-level neural networks API capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano

it can run seamlessly on both CPU and GPU

Keras makes it really for ML beginners to build and design a Neural Network, one of the best thing about Keras is that it allows for easy and fast prototyping


6. PyTorch

popular open-source Machine Learning library for Python based on Torch, which is an open-source Machine Learning library which is implemented in C with a wrapper in Lua

it has an extensive choice of tools and libraries that supports on Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing(NLP) and many more ML programs

it allows developers to perform computations on Tensors with GPU acceleration and also helps in creating computational graphs


import torch


7. Pandas

popular Python library for data analysis

Pandas comes handy as it was developed specifically for data extraction and preparation

it provides high-level data structures and wide variety tools for data analysis, it provides many inbuilt methods for grouping, combining and filtering data


import pandas as pd


8. Matplotlib

popular for data visualization


import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
