ROC curve (receiver operating characteristic curve) --->

a graph showing the performance of a classification model at all classification thresholds,
this curve plots two parameters:

i. True Positive Rate
ii. False Positive Rate



area under the ROC curve : AUC

* larger area under the ROC curve = better model


* desirable for the following two reasons:

	--> scale-invariant,
		it measures how well predictions are ranked, rather than their absolute values

	--> classification-threshold-invariant,
		measures the quality of the model's predictions irrespective of what classification threshold is chosen

but they are not always desirable
