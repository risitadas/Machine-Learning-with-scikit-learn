basics of linear regression


regression mechanics 

	* y = ax + b,
		where y = target, x = single feature, a,b = parameters of model

	* how do we choose a and b?

	* defining an error functions for any given line -
		choosing the line that minimizes the error function



Ordinary least squares(OLS) :
	minimize sum of squares of residuals


a Linear Regression model’s main aim is to find the best fit linear line and 
the optimal values of intercept and coefficients such that the error is minimized

error is the difference between the actual value and Predicted value and the goal is to reduce this difference


linear Regression is the supervised Machine Learning model in which the model finds the best fit linear line
 between the independent and dependent variable i.e it finds the linear relationship between the dependent and independent variable


two types: 

i) Simple Linear Regression is where only one independent variable is present and 
the model has to find the linear relationship of it with the dependent variable

equation --> 
	
	y = bo + b1x ,

where bo is the intercept, b1 is coefficient or slope, x is the independent variable and y is the dependent variable.



ii) Multiple Linear Regression there are more than one independent variables for the model to find the relationship

equation -->

	y = bo + b1 x1 + b2 x2 + b3 x3 + ...... + bn xn ,

where bo is the intercept, b1,b2,b3,b4…,bn are coefficients or slopes of the independent variables x1,x2,x3,x4…,xn and y is the dependent variable



in simple linear regression, 
we predict scores on one variable from the scores on a second variable,
the variable we are predicting is called the criterion variable and is referred to as Y, and,
the variable we are basing our predictions on is called the predictor variable and is referred to as X

when there is only one predictor variable, the prediction method is called simple regression

in simple linear regression, the predictions of Y when plotted as a function of X form a straight line
