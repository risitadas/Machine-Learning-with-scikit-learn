logistic regression and the ROC curve


* logistic regression output possibilities

* if the probability 'p' is greater than 0.5 :
	--> the data is labeled '1'

* if the probabilty 'p' is less than 0.5 :
	--> the data is labeled '0'



probabilty thresholds

* by default, logistic regression threshold - 0.5

* not specific to logistic regression 
	--> k-NN classifiers also have thresholds
